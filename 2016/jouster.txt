Jousters

* each jouster is identical
* jouster sits on a wheeled base with 2 motors driving 2 of 4 wheels
* wheeled base rides in tracks with a gap in the middle
* ir emitters and receivers are used to form breakbeam sensors to identify each
  end of each track
  * maybe add a piece of foam in the gap at the end of each track to give a softer stop?
  * jouster will be completely opaque (saddle, horse blanket, etc.) so whole body will
    break the sensor making detection time long (no need to worry about missing it)
* wires connecting the jouster to the controller hang and travel all over the
  place in the gap between the two tracks

* entire track is 16 feet long
  * wheels ride on a road of 2 lengths of plywood joined together with pocket screws
  * wheels are contained by walls cut from plywood nailed to the sides of the road
  * walls on tracks are 2 lengths of plywood, one cut in half so we have
    1/2 length, full length, 1/2 length down each side (provides support where the
    two lenghts of the "road" are joined)
  * join the two tracks at each end on a 2x4 to close it off
  * build 2x4 supports based on how floppy the assembly ends up being (both ends & middle?)

* when reset
  * each jouster does
    * if no breakbeam is active the go forward direction at slow speed
    * when jouster triggers a breakbeam stop
  * each jouster gets facing the right direction
    * if jouster is on beam 1 then servo at 0 degrees else servo at 180 degrees
  * if they are both on the same side, move jouster 1 down to the other side
    * start motor backward at slow speed
    * stop when breakbeam is detected
  * each jouster gets facing the right direction (see above)

* when triggered
  * play trumpet sound
  * turn on all motors at full
  * play horse galloping sound
  * wait until middle breakbeam is triggered
  * play crash sound
  * gradually slow down motors to slow speed
  * play trot sound
  * wait until ir breakbeam is triggered
  * stop motor
  * stop audio
  * goto reset
